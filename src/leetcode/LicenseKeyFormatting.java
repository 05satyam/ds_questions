/**
 * You are given a license key represented as a string s that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into n + 1 groups by n dashes. You are also given an integer k.
 *
 * We want to reformat the string s such that each group contains exactly k characters, except for the first group, which could be shorter than k but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups, and you should convert all lowercase letters to uppercase.
 *
 * Return the reformatted license key.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", k = 4
 * Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"
 * Explanation: The string s has been split into two parts, each part has 4 characters.
 * Note that the two extra dashes are not needed and can be removed.
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: s = "2-5g-3-J", k = 2
 * Output: "2-5G-3J"
 * Explanation: The string s has been split into three parts, each part has 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter as mentioned above.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= s.length <= 105
 * s consists of English letters, digits, and dashes '-'.
 * 1 <= k <= 104
