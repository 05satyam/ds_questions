/**
 * Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.
 *
 *
 *
 * Input: head = [1,1,1,2,3]
 * Output: [2,3]
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 300].
 * -100 <= Node.val <= 100
 * The list is guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
