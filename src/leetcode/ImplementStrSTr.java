/**
 * Implement strStr().
 *
 * Return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.
 *
 * Clarification:
 *
 * What should we return when needle is an empty string? This is a great question to ask during an interview.
 *
 * For the purpose of this problem, we will return 0 when needle is an empty string. This is consistent to C's strstr() and Java's indexOf().
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: haystack = "hello", needle = "ll"
 * Output: 2
